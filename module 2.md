## 🧱 1. Basic Graph Concepts (with Social Examples)

| Concept    | What It Means in Graph Theory         | Social Media Analogy                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Node**   | An entity (user, page, post)          | A Facebook user or an Instagram profile         |
| **Edge**   | A connection between two nodes        | A “friendship” or “follow”                      |
| **Walk**   | Any sequence of connected nodes/edges | Visiting users by clicking mutual friends       |
| **Path**   | A walk without revisiting nodes/edges | Smallest number of steps to reach someone       |
| **Cycle**  | A path that returns to the same node  | Going from A → B → C → A                        |
| **Bridge** | Removing this disconnects the graph   | One connector between two friend groups         |
| **Hub**    | A node with many connections          | Instagram influencer with millions of followers |

---

## 🎯 2. Degree and Degree Distribution

| Metric                  | Meaning in Social Graph                        | Example                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Degree**              | Number of direct connections                   | Facebook friends count                       |
| **In-degree**           | Number of followers (incoming)                 | Twitter: How many follow you                 |
| **Out-degree**          | Number you follow (outgoing)                   | Twitter: How many you follow                 |
| **Weighted Degree**     | Sum of edge weights (e.g., messages exchanged) | WhatsApp: Frequency of chats                 |
| **Degree Distribution** | How common each degree is across users         | Most users have few friends, a few have many |

📈 Social Media Reality:

* Facebook: **Most users have 100–500 friends**
* Twitter: **Power law** — most users have few followers, few have millions

📚 *Zafarani et al.* emphasize that **degree** is fundamental to finding **influencers** and **detecting bots** (e.g., high out-degree but low in-degree = likely spam account).

## 🧭 3. Centrality Measures – Who is “Central”?

Use the mnemonic: **"Don’t Come Between Even Politicians Having Power"**

| Metric          | What It Measures                                  | Analogy                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Degree**      | Immediate popularity                              | Who has the most friends?             |
| **Closeness**   | How fast can info spread from this node?          | Who can quickly DM everyone?          |
| **Betweenness** | Acts as bridge between communities                | Who connects family & work groups?    |
| **Eigenvector** | Connects to other important nodes                 | Friends with celebrities              |
| **PageRank**    | Weighted centrality with dampened influence       | Google's ranking of users             |
| **Katz**        | Accounts for all paths, longer paths penalized    | Popular even through indirect friends |
| **Harmonic**    | A closeness variant (robust in disconnected nets) | Stronger in partially connected nets  |

📘 *Chakraborty* explains **betweenness** as identifying “gatekeepers” in a network.

## 🌐 4. Clustering Coefficients – How “Clumpy” is Your Social Circle?

### 🔍 Local Clustering Coefficient

* “How likely are your friends to be friends with each other?”

📱 **Facebook**: High — families, colleges
📱 **LinkedIn**: High in same organization
📱 **Instagram**: Lower — fans follow celebs but don’t follow each other

### 🌎 Global Clustering Coefficient

* Measures this **across the entire network**

📚 This connects directly to **transitivity**: *If A is friends with B, and B with C, then A with C?*

---

## 🔁 5. Reciprocity – Do They Follow You Back?

* **Relevant only in directed networks** (Twitter, Instagram)
* **High reciprocity** = Mutual relationships (e.g., Facebook-like friendship)
* **Low reciprocity** = One-sided follows (e.g., celebrity accounts)

📘 Used to detect:

* **Fake accounts** (follow many, followed by none)
* **Strong relationships** (mutual connections)

---

## 🧩 6. Assortativity – Who Do You Befriend?

* **Assortative mixing** = people connect with **similar** others
  → e.g., LinkedIn: Engineers connect with engineers
* **Disassortative** = people connect with **dissimilar** nodes
  → e.g., Buyer–Seller, Expert–Novice

📈 Measured using **Pearson correlation** of node degrees.

🔁 Strong assortativity → Echo chambers
🌐 Disassortativity → Knowledge diversity

---

## 🧱 7. Connected Components – Islands in the Network

* A **component** is a subset where all nodes are reachable from each other.
* Most real networks have:

  * One **giant component**
  * Several **smaller disconnected islands**

📚 *Used for*:

* Epidemic modeling
* Recommendation systems
* Detecting **outliers or isolated users**

## 🧠 8. Summary Table

| Measure                | Use Case Example                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Degree Centrality      | Detecting Instagram influencers                      |
| Closeness Centrality   | Efficient news spreaders (e.g., LinkedIn recruiters) |
| Betweenness Centrality | Journalists bridging communities on Twitter          |
| Clustering Coefficient | Detecting tight friend groups on Facebook            |
| Reciprocity            | Detecting mutual vs. one-sided follows on X          |
| Assortativity          | Detecting echo chambers or diversity                 |
| Connected Components   | Finding isolated users in a Twitter bot network      |

Excellent — Module 2B dives into the **structural DNA of social networks** by introducing key **properties**, **models**, and **generative theories** that help us simulate, analyze, and understand real-world social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Let me break this down using analogies from social media, mnemonics, and comparisons from trusted sources like:

* 📘 *Social Network Analysis* by T. Chakraborty
* 📙 *Social Media Mining* by Zafarani et al.

---

## 🧠 1. Overview: Why Do We Use Network Models?

Real-world social networks are huge (millions to billions of users). To analyze them efficiently, we use **network models** that simulate **similar behavior** with simpler, mathematical graphs.

### 🚀 Benefits of Network Models:

* **Scalability**: Can simulate massive networks without full data.
* **Privacy**: No need to analyze real user data.
* **Experimentation**: Try “what-if” scenarios (e.g., removing a user).
* **Theory Development**: Understand underlying principles.

📌 Analogy: Think of a **flight simulator** instead of flying a real airplane. You model the core behaviors to learn and experiment safely.

## 🔍 2. Key Properties of Real-World Networks

Use the mnemonic: **“S3C DAH”**
(*Small-world*, *Scale-free*, *Clustering*, *Dynamic*, *Assortative*, *Hubs*)

| Property               | What It Means                              | Example on Social Media                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Small-world**        | Most users are a few steps apart           | 3.57 degrees of separation on Facebook |
| **Scale-free**         | Power-law degree distribution (a few hubs) | Influencers on Instagram or Twitter    |
| **High clustering**    | Friends of friends tend to be friends      | LinkedIn professionals in same company |
| **Dynamic**            | Networks evolve over time                  | New friendships, unfollows, etc.       |
| **Assortative mixing** | People connect to similar people           | Homophily: age, profession             |
| **Hubs**               | Nodes with massive connectivity            | Celebrities, top brands                |

---

## 📌 3. Small-World Networks – “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”

### 🔁 Idea:

> Any two users in the world can connect via a short path (avg 3–6 hops).

📚 Milgram’s experiment → Facebook (2016): Avg path = 3.57
📱 Instagram (2020 study): Path length \~2.3 to 4.3 (even shorter!)

### 🔄 Implication:

* Fast rumor/meme spread
* Viral content travels far quickly

📘 *Chakraborty* and *Watts & Strogatz* highlight this as a core SNA property.

---

## 📊 4. High Clustering Coefficient

### 🧩 What It Means:

> If A is connected to B and C, then B and C are probably connected too.

📌 Think: “Your friends are friends with each other.”

| Platform  | Clustering Coefficient |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Facebook  | 0.61                   |
| Instagram | 0.55                   |
| LinkedIn  | 0.39                   |
| Twitter   | 0.23                   |
| ER Random | \~0.001 (much lower)   |

📘 *Zafarani et al.* use this to explain **community formation** and **trust** — higher clustering = stronger group behavior.

---

## 📈 5. Scale-Free Networks & Power Law

### 🌐 What It Means:

> A few nodes have many connections, most have few.

📌 Aka “Rich get richer” or **preferential attachment**
→ New users follow popular accounts more than random ones.

### 📉 Power-law distribution:

$$
P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}
$$

📱 Social examples:

* Twitter: Most have < 100 followers, a few have millions
* Instagram: Micro-influencers vs. celebrities

📘 *Barabási–Albert Model* captures this property.

---

## 💥 Implications of Scale-Free Structure

| Strength                       | Weakness                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Robust to random failures**  | **Vulnerable to hub-targeted attacks** |
| **Fast information flow**      | **Fast misinformation flow**           |
| **Niche growth via long tail** | **Hard to moderate influencers**       |
| **Great for viral marketing**  | **Biased reach toward hubs**           |

---

## 🧪 6. Random Graphs: Erdős–Rényi Model (ER)

📌 Idea: Build a graph by connecting every pair of nodes with probability $p$.

### 2 Variants:

* **G(n, p)**: Fix number of nodes $n$, connect each edge with probability $p$
* **G(n, m)**: Fix nodes $n$ and edges $m$, pick $m$ edges randomly

### Properties:

| Measure                | ER Graphs      | Real Networks              |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Degree Distribution    | Poisson        | Power-law                  |
| Clustering Coefficient | Very low (\~p) | High                       |
| Path Length            | Short          | Even shorter (due to hubs) |
| Hubs                   | Rare           | Common                     |
| Structure              | Random         | Community-rich             |

📘 ER model is a **null model** or **baseline**: it helps us spot what's “non-random” in real networks.

---

## 🌱 7. Preferential Attachment & Barabási–Albert Model (BA)

📌 Real social networks grow over time — new nodes prefer to connect to already popular nodes.

### Rule:

* Connect to node $i$ with probability proportional to its degree

$$
P(i) = \frac{k_i}{\sum_j k_j}
$$

🎯 Result:

* Hubs emerge naturally
* Degree follows power-law
* More realistic than ER for social platforms

📘 *Simon’s Model* (1955) also described this for language, showing universal behavior.

---

## 🧬 8. Watts-Strogatz (WS) Model – Best of Both Worlds

📌 Combines:

* Regular graph (high clustering)
* Random rewiring (short path length)

### WS Model Properties:

| Feature             | Watts–Strogatz | Real Social Networks |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| Clustering          | High           | High                 |
| Path Length         | Short          | Short                |
| Degree Distribution | Uniform        | Power-law            |
| Hubs                | No             | Yes                  |

✅ Great for modeling *small-world behavior*
❌ Lacks *hubs* — doesn’t capture **influencers**

---

## 📚 9. Summary Table — Compare Models

| Property               | ER Model      | BA Model         | WS Model     | Real Social Networks    |

| Degree Distribution    | Poisson       | Power-law        | Uniform      | Power-law               |
| Clustering Coefficient | Low (\~p)     | Moderate         | High         | High                    |
| Small-World Effect     | Yes (log N)   | Maybe            | Yes          | Yes                     |
| Hubs                   | No            | Yes              | No           | Yes                     |
| Community Structure    | Weak          | Some             | Strong       | Strong                  |
| Applicability          | Baseline only | Scale-free study | Small-worlds | Combine both (hybrids!) |
