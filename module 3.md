Excellent! Module 3 is the **backbone of community analysis** in Social Network Analysis (SNA), diving into how people naturally group together in online spaces — from WhatsApp groups to influencer fanbases.

Let's break it down using social media analogies, easy mnemonics, and memorable frameworks. I’ll also link key concepts to classic books like:

* 📘 *Social Network Analysis* by Tanmoy Chakraborty
* 📙 *Social Media Mining* by Zafarani et al.

## 🎯 What’s This Module About?

It teaches you how to identify and analyze **"communities"** — tightly connected groups — in a network.

Think of it like:

> 📱 **Communities on social media = Group chats of people who talk a lot with each other.**

## 💬 1. What Is a Community?

**Community in a social network = a group of nodes more connected with each other than with the rest of the network.**

📱 Examples:

* Facebook group → “Explicit”
* Retweet cluster → “Implicit”

📘 *Zafarani et al.* stress that **communities help uncover hidden social structures.**

---

## 👥 2. Homophily: Why Do Communities Form?

> "Birds of a feather tweet together."

### People group based on:

* Age, location, interests, role, education...

📱 Example:

* Instagram foodies → #HealthyEating
* LinkedIn engineers → “Python Developers India”

📘 Homophily leads to **assortativity**, which drives clustering in real-world networks.

## 🧩 3. Types of Communities

| Type             | Description                         | Social Media Example                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Disjoint**     | Each user belongs to one group only | Twitter follower clusters                       |
| **Overlapping**  | Users belong to multiple groups     | Instagram: fitness + fashion + entrepreneurship |
| **Hierarchical** | Subgroups within groups             | Facebook: AI → AI India → AI Bangalore          |

## 🧠 5. Node-Centric Approaches — Think “K-Community Family”

| Method       | Key Idea                                   | Analogy                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **k-Clique** | All nodes ≤ k steps away                   | Instagram friend groups                       |
| **k-Clan**   | Must be ≤ k steps *within* the subgraph    | Tighter, self-contained clique                |
| **k-Club**   | Relaxed, not maximal                       | Subgroup in a group                           |
| **k-Core**   | Everyone has ≥ k connections               | Active Slack users in a workspace             |
| **k-Plex**   | Everyone connected to all except ≤ k nodes | Flexible LinkedIn endorsement clusters        |
| **k-Shell**  | Layers of the network (onion peel)         | Influence depth — core vs periphery followers |

📘 These methods are often used in LinkedIn-style networks to detect **professional groups**.

## 🪢 6. Edge-Based: Girvan–Newman Algorithm

### 🎯 Intuition:

> Remove the "bridges" between communities.

| Step | What It Does                   | Social Analogy                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Calculate **edge betweenness** | How many shortest paths pass through a link |
| 2    | Remove highest EB edge         | Weakest tie between groups                  |
| 3    | Repeat until subgraphs appear  | Communities = disconnected clusters         |

📘 Based on **“Strength of Weak Ties”** by Granovetter — weak ties link **different communities**.

---

## 📈 7. Modularity: Measuring Community Quality

> How much better is the real grouping than random grouping?

### Formula (simplified):

$$
Q = \text{(actual internal edges)} - \text{(expected internal edges)}
$$

| Value of Q | Meaning                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 0.3–0.7    | Good community structure |
| 0          | Like random network      |
| < 0        | Worse than random        |

📘 Louvain Method uses **greedy modularity maximization** to detect communities efficiently.

---

## 🧠 8. Louvain Algorithm (Two Phases)

| Phase       | What Happens                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Each node joins neighbor's group if it increases modularity |
| **Phase 2** | Communities become nodes; repeat                            |

### Key Traits:

* Hierarchical
* Fast: O(n log n)
* Used in real-world tools like Facebook & Twitter

---

## 🤹 9. Overlapping Community Detection

> “I’m in AI, Startups, and Yoga groups.”

### Methods:

* **Clique Percolation (CPM)**:

  * Connect adjacent k-cliques
  * Overlapping groups via shared members
* **Link Partitioning**:

  * Group by **edges** instead of nodes
  * Better for capturing multi-role users

📱 Instagram example:

* Likes = Fitness group
* DMs = Fashion group
* Comments = Tech group

📘 *Link Partitioning* is great for **interest-based segmentation**.

---

## 📍 10. Local Community Detection

### Why Local?

* Fast, scalable
* Personalized (used by Facebook/Instagram)
* Works in dynamic environments

### Methods:

| Method                  | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Seed Expansion**      | Start from a node and grow                |
| **Local Louvain**       | Merge nearby nodes to maximize modularity |
| **Subgraph Modularity** | Maximize In-degree / Out-degree           |

📘 Used in “People You May Know”, local recommendations, or Twitter trends.

## 🔍 11. Community Search vs. Detection

| Feature     | Detection              | Search                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Goal        | Find *all* communities | Find community of a *query node* |
| Scope       | Global                 | Local                            |
| Scalability | Low (heavy)            | High (real-time)                 |
| Algorithms  | Louvain, CPM           | k-core, k-truss, k-ECC           |

📘 Community Search is like:

> “Find my tribe” vs. “Map the whole city.”

## 🧭 2. Key Detection Techniques

### Mnemonic: **"LEG" → Louvain, Edge betweenness, Girvan-Newman**

Let’s understand **Edge Betweenness**, **Girvan-Newman**, and **Modularity** with a complete, **step-by-step solved example**. But first…

---

## 🧮 3. Edge Betweenness Explained

**Edge Betweenness** = Number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through a given edge.

### 🔁 Formula:

For an edge $e$,

$$
EB(e) = \sum_{s \ne t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(e)}{\sigma_{st}}
$$

Where:

* $\sigma_{st}$ = number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$
* $\sigma_{st}(e)$ = number of those paths passing through edge $e$

---

## 🧩 4. Girvan–Newman Algorithm

### Step-by-step:

1. Compute **edge betweenness** of every edge.
2. Remove the edge with **highest EB score**.
3. Recompute EB after each removal.
4. Repeat until desired number of communities is formed.

---

## 🧪 5. Modularity — Measuring Community Quality

**Modularity** $Q$ quantifies the **strength of division** of a network into communities.

$$
Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i,j} \left[ A_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \right] \delta(c_i, c_j)
$$

Where:

* $A_{ij}$: adjacency matrix
* $k_i, k_j$: degree of nodes $i, j$
* $m$: total number of edges
* $\delta(c_i, c_j) = 1$ if $i, j$ are in the same community, else 0

---

## ✅ 6. Solved Example: Edge Betweenness, Girvan-Newman & Modularity

### 🧱 Graph:

Nodes: A, B, C, D, E
Edges: AB, AC, BC, CD, CE, DE

```
    A
   / \
  B---C
       \
        D
       /
      E
```

### 🔹 Step 1: Compute Edge Betweenness

We calculate the shortest paths between **all pairs**:

| Pairs | Shortest Paths | Passing Through Which Edge(s)? |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| A–B   | A–B            | AB                             |
| A–C   | A–C            | AC                             |
| A–D   | A–C–D          | AC, CD                         |
| A–E   | A–C–E          | AC, CE                         |
| B–C   | B–C            | BC                             |
| B–D   | B–C–D          | BC, CD                         |
| B–E   | B–C–E          | BC, CE                         |
| C–D   | C–D            | CD                             |
| C–E   | C–E            | CE                             |
| D–E   | D–E            | DE                             |

Now count how many times each edge appears:

| Edge | Count |
| ---- | ----- |
| AB   | 1     |
| AC   | 3     |
| BC   | 3     |
| CD   | 3     |
| CE   | 3     |
| DE   | 1     |

### 🔹 Step 2: Remove Highest Betweenness Edge(s)

Edges AC, BC, CD, CE all tie with EB = 3 → Pick any (say, **CD**).

New Graph:

```
    A
   / \
  B---C    D
           |
           E
```

Graph splits into two components: {A, B, C} and {D, E}

### 🔹 Step 3: Recalculate EB and Repeat

Now recompute edge betweenness in **each component** and remove highest EB edges (e.g., CE or BC next).

### 🔹 Final Communities (after iterative removal):

* {A, B, C}
* {D, E}

---

### 🧠 Now Calculate Modularity

Let's assume we got 2 communities:

* Comm1: A, B, C
* Comm2: D, E

Degrees:

* A: 2, B: 2, C: 3, D: 2, E: 2
* Total edges $m = 6$

Only **intra-community edges**:

* AB, AC, BC (in Comm1): 3 edges
* DE (in Comm2): 1 edge

Apply modularity formula:

$$
Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i,j \in C} \left[ A_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \right]
$$

Let’s compute only for **Comm1**:

* AB: $A_{ij} = 1, \frac{2 \cdot 2}{12} = 0.333 \Rightarrow 1 - 0.333 = 0.667$
* AC: $2 \cdot 3 / 12 = 0.5 \Rightarrow 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$
* BC: $2 \cdot 3 / 12 = 0.5 \Rightarrow 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$

Sum = $0.667 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.667$

Repeat for DE:

* $2 \cdot 2 / 12 = 0.333 \Rightarrow 1 - 0.333 = 0.667$

Final modularity:

$$
Q = \frac{1}{12}(1.667 + 0.667) = \frac{2.334}{12} \approx 0.195
$$

🔍 This is low — better community splits should give higher $Q$ (usually 0.3–0.7 is good).
