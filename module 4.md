**Forms**:

* As part of **CSR** or **SHE (Safety, Health & Environment)**
* Voluntary reporting, beyond legal compliance

**Theoretical Roots**:

* **Natural Resource-Based View (NRBV)**: Firms gain competitive advantage via eco-efficiency
* **Neo-Institutional Theory**: Organizational change shaped by external pressures

**CER Mechanisms (Mnemonic – “RMS”)**:

* **S**elf-regulation: UNGC, GRI, voluntary codes

---

### 🚧 **Barriers to CER**

**Institutional Barriers**:

* Rigid capital planning (e.g., ROI over sustainability)
* Lack of eco-costing in financial metrics

**Cognitive Barriers**:

* Habitual thinking
* Lack of awareness, training, and leadership vision

**Solutions**:

* EMS training (Zutshi & Sohal, 2004)
* Stakeholder engagement
* Belief/value transformation at all levels
