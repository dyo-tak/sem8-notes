Great! Let's break down these topics from Social Network Analysis (SNA) in a structured, easy-to-remember, and intuitive way. We'll use relatable analogies, visual thinking, and refer back to key ideas from **Chakraborty (2021)** to anchor our understanding.

## 🧩 1. Preliminaries and Important Terminologies

Let’s use a **domino effect party analogy** 🎉:

### 💡 Key Terms:

| Term                      | Meaning                                     | Analogy                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cascade**               | Spread of behavior/info through the network | Like one person starting a dance at a party, and others join in |
| **Information Diffusion** | How that info spreads over time             | The song getting louder so more people hear and dance           |
| **Activated Node**        | A person who joins the dance                | A node that’s "turned on" or influenced                         |
| **Activation Time (t)**   | When a node joins the dance                 | E.g., Person starts dancing at t = 3 mins                       |
| **Threshold (θ)**         | Minimum peer pressure to join               | A shy person needs at least 3 dancing friends nearby to start   |

This sets the stage for understanding models that simulate these dynamics.

## 🔄 2. Cascade Models

### 🎯 2.1 **Decision-Based Models**

#### ✅ **Linear Threshold Model (LTM)**

Think of each person (node) as needing a certain level of **peer pressure** (threshold) to act.

**Mechanism**:

* Each node has a **threshold** θ ∈ \[0,1]
* Each neighbor's influence is a **weight** (w₍ᵤᵥ₎)
* Node gets activated if:
  $\sum_{u \in A(t)} w_{uv} \geq \theta_v$

**Example**:
You’ll try a new app only if enough of your friends (weighted by how close you are) have already joined.

📘 Chakraborty links this to how **influence and adoption** work in social settings, especially relevant in marketing and behavioral modeling.

---

### 🎨 2.2 **Multiple Choice Decision-Based Model**

Now imagine choosing **between multiple brands**, not just adopting or rejecting.

Each node:

* Computes **utility** of each choice.
* Chooses the one with the **highest utility**.

💡 Useful in **product competition scenarios** (e.g., Coke vs. Pepsi).

---

## 🦠 3. Epidemic Models

These model **how things spread like a disease** — rumors, viruses, ideas.

### 3.1 🌀 **SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible)**

* S → I → S
* Like a cold: you catch it, recover, but can catch it again.

### 3.2 🔥 **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)**

* S → I → R
* Once recovered, you’re immune (ideal for modeling **rumor or info spread** that you only believe once).

### 3.3 🕵️ **SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered)**

* Adds **Exposed (E)** stage: you’re infected but not yet contagious.
* Great for modeling **delays or latency** in transmission (like **info processing time**).

| Model | Best For                                       |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| SIS   | Temporary behavior                             |
| SIR   | Permanent adoption                             |
| SEIR  | Info with delay (e.g., training before acting) |

📘 Chakraborty emphasizes that these models help bridge **network theory with epidemiology**, useful in digital marketing and cyber-epidemic studies.

## 🧠 4. Rumor Spread – SEIZ Model

This one is tailor-made for **rumor dynamics**.

### States:

* **S**: Hasn’t heard the rumor
* **E**: Heard it, thinking about it
* **I**: Believes and spreads it
* **Z**: Skeptic — heard it but won’t spread

**Transitions**:

* S → E → I
* or S → Z (if skeptical)

📘 Chakraborty applies SEIZ to online platforms (e.g., Twitter), where people may see a post but choose not to share it.

---

## 🎲 5. Independent Cascade (IC) Models

Think of a **chain reaction** where each influencer gets one chance to persuade their friends.

### Mechanism:

* Active node **u** tries once to activate neighbor **v** with probability **pᵤᵥ**.
* If successful, **v** becomes active at next time step.
* Process continues until no new activations.

🔁 It's **stochastic**: introduces randomness, unlike deterministic threshold models.

📘 Chakraborty ties this to **viral marketing**, where each customer has a limited chance to influence their friends.

---

## 🤖 6. Cascade Prediction Models

These models aim to **predict the future** of information spread using deep learning.

### 6.1 🧬 **DeepCas**

* Learns from cascade graphs and **temporal sequences**.
* Uses **RNNs** to model how information propagates over time.
* Outputs: **Predicted cascade size**

🧠 Think: “Given the first 10 people who shared this tweet, how big will it get?”

### 6.2 🔮 **DeepHawkes**

* Based on **Hawkes process** (self-exciting point process).
* Models **intensity of interactions over time**.
* Learns **mutual influences** using neural nets.

📘 These are **state-of-the-art** and Chakraborty mentions them in the context of **forecasting** viral content and understanding real-time dynamics.

## 🧠 TL;DR — Mnemonic Summary

Use the acronym **"CIDER DIP"** to recall key sections:

1. **C** – Cascade Basics (Cascade, Threshold, Activation)
2. **I** – Independent Cascade
3. **D** – Decision-Based Models (LTM, Multi-choice)
4. **E** – Epidemic Models (SIS, SIR, SEIR)
5. **R** – Rumor Models (SEIZ)
6. **D** – Deep Learning Models (DeepCas, DeepHawkes)
7. **I** – Influence Weights (wuv, θ)
8. **P** – Prediction of Cascades
