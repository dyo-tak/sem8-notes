## 🧩 **Key Concepts and Mnemonics**

### 📦 Core Characteristics of Social Media — *“P.O.C.C.C.C.”*

* **P**articipation – Everyone can contribute
* **O**penness – Few barriers; feedback welcomed
* **C**onversation – Not one-way like TV, it's interactive
* **C**ommunity – Like-minded groups form easily
* **C**onnectedness – Hyperlinked to other content/people
* **C**ollaboration – Sharing, remixing, co-creating content

📘 This aligns with Kaplan & Haenlein’s framework in *“Users of the world, unite!”* which defines social media by collaborative and participatory culture.

| I      | Influence  | Influencers via network centrality  |
| T      | Tech crowd | GitHub, developer collaboration     |

---

## 🔍 SECTION 1: **Facebook Analytics** — *“Audience Magnet”*

### 📊 Core Analytics Categories:

| Metric Type   | Examples                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Page**      | Reach, likes, follows, visits                          |
| **Post**      | Post engagement, link clicks, shares                   |
| **Video**     | Video plays, watch %                                   |
| **Reels**     | Reach, shares, reactions                               |
| **Pixel**     | Tracks *off-Facebook* behavior (like Google Analytics) |
| **Ads**       | CPC, CPM, link clicks                                  |
| **Group**     | Engagement, top contributors                           |
| **Sentiment** | User feelings towards your brand                       |

### 📌 Real-world analogy:

Think of your **Facebook page** as a **café**:

* **Visitors (reach)** = footfall
* **Likes/follows** = returning customers
* **Shares/comments** = word of mouth
* **Pixel** = security camera seeing how people browse your shop

📚 *Zafarani et al.* emphasize user-level behavioral tracking for community detection and influence modeling — this is where **Facebook Groups** and **Pixel** data become invaluable.

---

## 📷 SECTION 2: **Instagram Analytics** — *“Visual Storytelling Engine”*

### 🎯 What to track?

| Metric              | Why it matters                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Views / Impressions | Awareness level                    |
| Reach               | Unique users reached               |
| Saves / Shares      | Value & virality                   |
| Audience Growth     | Brand expansion                    |
| Watch-through Rate  | Engagement for Reels/Stories       |
| Engagement Rate     | Combined metric for total reaction |
| Profile Visits      | Content interest                   |
| Website Clicks      | Funnel conversion                  |

### 📌 Analogy:

Instagram = **a visual billboard**.

* If people **watch the full video** → your ad is sticky
* If they **click your profile link** → you hooked them in
* If they **save your post** → it's valuable

🔗 **Hashtags**, **Reels reach**, and **Follower insights** form the basis of **network discovery** and **topic propagation**, as seen in *Chakraborty’s SNA discussions* on node-level interaction.

---

## 💼 SECTION 3: **LinkedIn Analytics** — *“Professional Graph Lens”*

### 🧩 What’s measured?

| Metric            | Use Case                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Engagement Rate   | Content effectiveness            |
| Influence Score   | Thought leadership               |
| Connection Growth | Network expansion                |
| Job Trends        | Skill-based opportunity spotting |
| Campaign metrics  | B2B ad targeting & lead quality  |

### 📌 SNA Insight:

LinkedIn graphs are a goldmine for **bipartite analysis** (user–company, job–skill, etc.):

📘 Chakraborty covers this via **projected graphs** — for instance:

* People connected to the same company → form a latent cluster.
* Top influencers = nodes with high *betweenness centrality* (they connect sub-networks).

---

## 🐦 SECTION 4: **Twitter & GitHub Case Studies** — *“SNA in Action”*

### 🐦 Twitter – **Sentiment + Trend Prediction**

* Use NLP to track sentiment around elections, brands, crises.
* Public opinion changes mapped through **temporal network analysis**.

### 🧑‍💻 GitHub – **Collaboration Network**

* Track forks, commits, issues = *actions as edges in a graph*.
* Central users = maintainers.
* Projects with **low average response time** → better success rate.

📘 In *Social Media Mining*, GitHub-like networks are cited as examples of **collaboration graphs**, where:

* **Nodes** = developers
* **Edges** = collaborations via commits/pull requests

---

## 🔁 SECTION 5: **Cross-Platform Applications Using SNA** — *“Graph Power”*

Here’s a table linking **SNA technique** with its **practical application**:

| SNA Technique              | Application                              | Example Platform   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Influencer Detection**   | Centrality-based analysis                | Instagram/Twitter  |
| **Community Detection**    | Modularity, Louvain, label propagation   | Facebook/LinkedIn  |
| **Information Diffusion**  | Cascade modeling, temporal graphs        | Twitter            |
| **Customer Segmentation**  | Cluster user behavior                    | Instagram/Facebook |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Link prediction, collaborative filtering | GitHub/YouTube     |
| **Fraud Detection**        | Anomaly in network structure             | LinkedIn           |
| **Sentiment Propagation**  | Sentiment + social graph overlay         | Facebook/Twitter   |
| **Network Evolution**      | Time-based graph analytics               | GitHub/Instagram   |

📘 These align with *Chakraborty's* SNA topics on:

* **Dynamic graphs** (for evolution and trend detection)
* **Edge weights** and **directionality** (e.g., retweet = directed, like = undirected)
