Thanks for sharing Module 1! This is your **foundation stone** in Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Social Media Analytics (SMA). Let's break it down into **digestible, memorable concepts**, using analogies from social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram — all while tying in key insights from trusted books like:

* 📘 *Social Network Analysis* by Tanmoy Chakraborty
* 📙 *Social Media Mining* by Zafarani et al.

## 🎯 HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY — Use the mnemonic **"SNA-PAD"**

| Letter | Concept                          | Think of…                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **S**  | Social Media vs. Social Networks | Platforms vs. relationships       |
| **N**  | Network Basics                   | Nodes (users) and Edges (links)   |
| **A**  | Analytics: SMA & SNA             | What is measured & why            |
| **P**  | Perspectives (Micro/Meso/Macro)  | Zooming in and out of the network |
| **A**  | Applications                     | From memes to cybercrime          |
| **D**  | Data Representations             | Matrices, lists, and visual tools |

## 🧵 1. **Social Media vs. Social Networks**

### 🧠 Analogy:

* **Social Media** = A **stage** (Twitter, Instagram)
* **Social Network** = The **audience and cast** interacting

📌 **Social Media** is the platform.
📌 **Social Network** is the web of relationships on or off that platform.

📘 *Zafarani et al.* describe this as the difference between *content generation (SMA)* vs. *structure modeling (SNA)*.

## 🌐 2. **Network Basics: Nodes and Edges**

| Element       | In Social Terms             | Example                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Node (Vertex) | Person, account, post       | You, @elonmusk, a TikTok video  |
| Edge (Link)   | Relationship or interaction | Follows, mentions, likes        |
| Directed Edge | A follows B                 | Twitter or Instagram            |
| Undirected    | A and B are mutual friends  | Facebook                        |
| Weight        | Strength of tie             | # of DMs, likes, shares         |
| Attributes    | Metadata                    | Age, location, category of post |

🔁 **Self-loops** = A node interacts with itself (e.g., reposting your own content)
🔁 **Parallel edges** = Multiple links between the same two nodes (e.g., DM + tag + like)

## 📊 3. **Social Media Analytics (SMA) vs. Social Network Analysis (SNA)**

| Feature      | SMA                                 | SNA                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Focus        | Content & engagement                | Structure of relationships          |
| Techniques   | NLP, sentiment, trends              | Graph theory, centrality, diffusion |
| Limitation   | Can't detect influence or community | Doesn't work on isolated content    |
| Example Tool | Twitter Analytics                   | Gephi, NetworkX, Cytoscape          |
| Analogy      | What’s being said                   | Who’s saying it and to whom         |

📌 **They are complementary**: SMA tells *what happened*, SNA tells *how & why it spread*.

## 🔍 4. **Zoom In: The 3 Levels of Network Analysis (Micro–Meso–Macro)**

### 🧩 Use the mnemonic **“EMM”** — Ego, Motif, Mass

| Level           | View                     | Focus                           | Example                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Microscopic** | Node-level (ego-centric) | Pairs, triads, clustering       | Friendship triangle on Instagram   |
| **Mesoscopic**  | Subgroup                 | Communities, motifs             | Reddit subreddits                  |
| **Macroscopic** | Whole network            | Path lengths, density, diameter | Entire Facebook or Twitter network |

📘 *Chakraborty* details triads and motifs as “building blocks” of social structure.

---

## 📈 5. **Key Graph Representations**

### A. **Adjacency Matrix** (Sociomatrix)

* Square matrix $A[i][j] = 1$ if there’s a connection
* Great for math but space-heavy (useful for small graphs)

📘 Bonus: Multiply matrix $A^2$ to count paths of length 2 between nodes.

### B. **Adjacency List**

* Each node → list of its neighbors
* Efficient for sparse networks (like real-world social networks)

### C. **Edge List**

* Just a list of all edges like `(u, v)`
* Compact, great for streaming data

### D. **Sociogram**

* Visual graph with circles (nodes) and lines (edges)

## 🎯 6. **Types of Social Graphs: Think of “DUVANS”**

| Type             | Key Idea                           | Example                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **D**irected     | One-way links                      | Twitter follow                 |
| **U**ndirected   | Mutual links                       | Facebook friendship            |
| **V**alued       | Edge weights                       | Frequency of WhatsApp messages |
| **A**ttributed   | Metadata on nodes/edges            | Age/location of users          |
| **N**ode-centric | Focus on nodes (e.g., influencers) | Centrality scores              |
| **S**igned       | Trust/distrust or like/dislike     | Reddit upvotes/downvotes       |

## 🤹 7. **Special Graphs and Use Cases**

### 🎯 Ego-centric:

* Analyze network around a single node (the “ego”)
* Example: Your Instagram mentions + DMs

### 🕸️ Bipartite:

* Two sets of nodes (e.g., users and movies)
* Example: Netflix — User → Movie rating

### 🔀 Multidimensional:

* Different layers (e.g., social + follower + topic interest)
* Example: Twitter with layers for retweets and hashtags

### ⏳ Temporal:

* Time-based network snapshots
* Example: WhatsApp forwards over a week

### 📚 Hypergraph:

* Edges connect *multiple* nodes
* Example: Co-authorship (one paper = one hyperedge)
